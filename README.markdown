Isometric terrain renderer
==========================

Playing around with techniques for generating isometric terrains, ala SimCity 3000.

I blame notch, watching him code the 3D rendering of 0x10c reignited my interest in playing around with isometric projections.

This is a hack. I'm playing around more to understand the ideas and techniques behind isometric rendering. So don't use this for your next blockbuster game, mmmmkay?
